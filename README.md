# Cash Register
I created a cash register using pure JavaScript and CSS. It was quite a challenge for me since I attempted to do it on my own with minimal assistance. Although I believe the code could have been optimized further, the experience of developing it independently proved to be invaluable in terms of learning. The cash register performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
